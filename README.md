A time series is a set of observations recorded over time, usually at regular intervals (seconds, minutes, hours, days).

# Industrial Sensors Time Series Notebook
Notebook showcasing essential Pandas techniques for handling and analyzing industrial sensor time series data. This project demonstrates how to work with time series data from industrial sensors using Python and Pandas. It covers key operations such as timestamp conversion, resampling, rolling windows, and lag features, providing a foundation for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.
